Notes for Alan (and others who are interested)
==============================================

Some would say that command history (with up and down arrow keys) is buggy,
but I prefer to think of it as having unique features.

As of now, program input must be in pairs of hexadecimal digits, separated by space.
I did not know at the time of submitting the current version whether we needed to support
any string of hex, or if it needed to be the form of "A0 B1 C3" etc. If anything, I demonstrated
a greater understanding of regex the way I did it, so ha!
